Problem with pushing to GitHub.
-------------------------------
When pushing to GitHub from Eclipse, some of the students got error message 'not authorized'.
The following steps will fix that in Eclipse.

![push](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscsbend/sandbox/master/4thex/images/readme/push.png)

![not authorized](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscsbend/sandbox/master/4thex/images/readme/push2.png)

Click ‘Configure…’-button.

![configure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscsbend/sandbox/master/4thex/images/readme/configure.png)

Click ‘Change…’-button.

![Enter correct password and check](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscsbend/sandbox/master/4thex/images/readme/change.png)

Type the correct password, and check ‘Store in Secure Store’-checkbox. Now that there is a wrong password (probably) already in the store, you MUST check the checkbox to correct it.
Click ‘Finish’-button.

![change](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mscsbend/sandbox/master/4thex/images/readme/configure2.png)

Click ‘Save and Push’-button.
It should work now.
